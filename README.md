# Multiple Diseases Prediction System


## Overview

It is an advanced Multiple Diseases Prediction System designed to leverage the power of machine learning for proactive healthcare. This repository houses the source code for predicting three critical health conditions: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. By integrating cutting-edge technology with healthcare, HealthGuard empowers users with early insights, facilitating timely interventions and preventive measures.

## Key Features

- **Diabetes Prediction:**
  - Harnesses a sophisticated machine learning model to predict the probability of diabetes based on diverse health parameters.

- **Heart Disease Prediction:**
  - Implements a state-of-the-art machine learning model for the early detection of heart disease, offering crucial insights into cardiovascular health.

- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction:**
  - Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to predict Parkinson's disease by analyzing specific features and patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Web Application Framework:** Streamlit

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into modular components:

- `diabetes_prediction`: Contains the source code for the diabetes prediction module.
- `heart_disease_prediction`: Houses the source code for the heart disease prediction module.
- `parkinsons_prediction`: Encompasses the source code for the Parkinson's disease prediction module.
- `MDP.py`: Integration script for creating a cohesive Streamlit-based web application combining all prediction modules.
