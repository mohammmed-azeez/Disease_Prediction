# Multiple Diseases Prediction System Using ML


## Overview

It is an advanced Multiple Diseases Prediction System designed to leverage the power of machine learning for proactive healthcare. This repository houses the source code for predicting three critical health conditions: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. By integrating cutting-edge technology with healthcare, HealthGuard empowers users with early insights, facilitating timely interventions and preventive measures.

## Key Features
